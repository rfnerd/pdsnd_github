### Date created
March 25th 2021.

### Project Title
Uploading my python project to Github repo.

### Description
Previously I worked on a python project where I used a set of data provided by a bike rental company in the US. In that project I ask user to apply his preferred filter and based on it the code provides insightful info about customers' stats. Such as most popular month, day and starting station...etc. Now, in this project I will apply my knowledge of version control to upload (push) my files to Github. Enjoy the journey! :)

### Files used
bikeshare.py, readme.mg, new_york_city.csv, chicago.csv, washington.csv (csv files are ignored using a .gitignore file)

### Credits
I give the credit to course tutors and all the great students who gave a brief of their work to the community! Thank you all!
