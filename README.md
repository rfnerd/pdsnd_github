### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Project - 2021

### Description
This project I use data provided by Udacity about a bike rental company in the US. In my code I start by ask the user to apply his preferred filter in terms of city, month and day, then based on the input from the user, the code provides insightful statistics about the data. Such as the most popular month, day and starting station...etc. After completing the bikeshare project, I'm now applying my knowledge of version control to upload (push) my files to Github. Enjoy! :)

### Files used
bikeshare.py, readme.mg, new_york_city.csv, chicago.csv, washington.csv (csv files are ignored using a .gitignore file)

### Credits
I give the credit to course tutors and all the great students who gave a brief of their work to the community! Thank you all!
